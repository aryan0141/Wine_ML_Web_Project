# Wine_ML_Web_Project
A website in which you can check the quality of your wine.

You can refer data.csv to see the complete dataset that we used.

Backend is done in Django.

The website is not responsive at that time...later it may be changed to the responsive one.

We used random forest regressor to train the model and get an accuracy of 85.3%.
